# Ideas

This is a fantastic idea! Let's reimagine this command storage system using magical terminology. Here are some suggested command/operation pairs:

For Creating/Managing Spellbooks:
- `inscribe` - Create a new spellbook (init a new splbk.md)
- `bind` - Associate/initialize a spellbook with an existing repository
- `attune` - Set up configuration for a spellbook
- `enchant` - Modify spellbook settings or metadata

For Adding Commands ("Spells"):
- `scribe` - Write a new spell (command) to the book
- `transcribe` - Copy a spell from another spellbook
- `imbue` - Add tags or additional properties to a spell
- `weave` - Create a complex spell (command) with multiple steps

For Getting/Using Commands:
- `invoke` - Execute a stored spell (command)
    - `cast`?
- `recall` - Search for and display a spell without executing it
- `study` - Show detailed information about a spell
- `channel` - Run a spell with modifications
- `divine` - Search through spells using tags or keywords

For Organization:
- `codex` - List all spells in the current spellbook
- `grimoire` - Show the full contents of the spellbook
- `school` - Group or filter spells by type/category
- `tome` - Switch between different spellbooks

Additional Features:
- `apprentice` - Interactive mode for learning/browsing spells
- `ritual` - Execute a sequence of spells
- `scroll` - Export spells to share with others
- `commune` - Import spells from another source

Your sections in splbk.md could be organized as:
- Schools of Magic (instead of Solutions)
- Incantations (instead of Features)
- Spells (instead of Commands)

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these terms or suggest additional magical terminology for specific features?
