# Ideas

This is a fantastic idea! Let's reimagine this command storage system using magical terminology. Here are some suggested command/operation pairs:

For Creating/Managing Spellbooks:
- `inscribe` - Create a new spellbook (init a new splbk.md)
- `bind` - Associate/initialize a spellbook with an existing repository
- `attune` - Set up configuration for a spellbook
- `enchant` - Modify spellbook settings or metadata

For Adding Commands ("Spells"):
- `scribe` - Write a new spell (command) to the book
- `transcribe` - Copy a spell from another spellbook
- `imbue` - Add tags or additional properties to a spell
- `weave` - Create a complex spell (command) with multiple steps

For Getting/Using Commands:
- `invoke` - Execute a stored spell (command)
    - `cast`?
- `recall` - Search for and display a spell without executing it
- `study` - Show detailed information about a spell
- `channel` - Run a spell with modifications
- `divine` - Search through spells using tags or keywords

For Organization:
- `codex` - List all spells in the current spellbook
- `grimoire` - Show the full contents of the spellbook
- `school` - Group or filter spells by type/category
- `tome` - Switch between different spellbooks

Additional Features:
- `apprentice` - Interactive mode for learning/browsing spells
- `ritual` - Execute a sequence of spells
- `scroll` - Export spells to share with others
- `commune` - Import spells from another source

Your sections in splbk.md could be organized as:
- Schools of Magic (instead of Solutions)
- Incantations (instead of Features)
- Spells (instead of Commands)

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these terms or suggest additional magical terminology for specific features?
Here are some evocative magical phrases and terminology you could incorporate:

For the command types/categories:
- "Ancient Incantations"
- "Arcane Formulae"
- "Mystic Bindings"
- "Eldritch Invocations"
- "Ethereal Conjurations"
- "Forbidden Utterances"
- "Astral Sequences"
- "Runic Commands"

For actions/operations:
- "Channeling arcane wisdom..."
- "Weaving ethereal threads..."
- "Invoking ancient knowledge..."
- "Drawing from the astral archives..."
- "Manifesting eldritch power..."
- "Unveiling mystic secrets..."
- "Consulting the ethereal codex..."
- "Tracing runic patterns..."

For error messages or states:
- "The arcane energies resist your attempt"
- "Your magical focus wavers"
- "The spell fades from memory"
- "The ethereal connection is lost"
- "The runes remain dormant"
- "Your incantation echoes into void"
- "The astral alignment is incorrect"
- "The mystic resonance falters"

For success messages:
- "The spell manifests successfully"
- "Arcane energies coalesce"
- "The ethereal patterns align"
- "Your invocation takes form"
- "The runes pulse with power"
- "Mystic forces respond to your call"
- "The astral channels open"
- "Eldritch knowledge flows forth"

For search/discovery:
- "Divining through ancient tomes..."
- "Scrying the mystical archives..."
- "Seeking through arcane manuscripts..."
- "Consulting ethereal indices..."
- "Traversing astral records..."
- "Peering into eldritch knowledge..."

These could be used in your CLI output, documentation, or help text to maintain the magical theme throughout the application. Would you like me to suggest more specific applications for any of these terms?
